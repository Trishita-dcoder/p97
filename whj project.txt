
    PROBLEM							SOLUTION
1)Health Checkup App		1)There will be a system of inputs where we can give the reading of the rates of different parts and there will be some conditions
				   like if the heart rate is between a range that is suitable for us then it will show whether it is normal high or low.


2)Restaurant App		2)According to my idea there will a Home Screen where there will a Welcome greeting, then we'll have to choose what kind of orders 
				   we want right now like the 'Starters' or 'Main Course' and then we will be navigated to the menu chart, from there we will select
				    the one we want to have and and at the last if there's any discount we will show the SP and there will be the payment procedures at the last.
